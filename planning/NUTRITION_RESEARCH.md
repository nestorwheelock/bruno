## The Warburg Effect & Cancer Metabolism

### Primary Research

**Vail DM, Ogilvie GK, Wheeler SL, Fettman MJ, Johnston SD, Hegstad RL.**
"Alterations in carbohydrate metabolism in canine lymphoma."
*Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine.* 1990;4(1):8-14.
PMID: [2407842](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2407842/)

**Key Findings:**
- Lactate concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.001) at baseline and all time periods of glucose tolerance tests in dogs with lymphoma compared to controls
- Insulin concentrations were also significantly higher (P < 0.001) at baseline
- Results indicate carbohydrate metabolism is altered in dogs with lymphoma
- Alterations parallel those observed in human cancer cachexia

### Follow-up Studies

**Ogilvie GK, Walters LM, Salman MD, Fettman MJ, Johnston SD, Hegstad RL.**
"Alterations in carbohydrate metabolism in dogs with nonhematopoietic malignancies."
*American Journal of Veterinary Research.* 1997;58(3):277-81.
PMID: [9055974](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9055974/)

**Key Findings:**
- Mean lactate (12.9 +/- 6.7 mg/dl) and insulin (69.1 +/- 44.9 microU/ml) in dogs with nonhematopoietic malignancies were significantly higher than controls
- Abnormalities do NOT normalize even when dogs are rendered free of gross evidence of malignant disease

**Ogilvie GK, Walters L, Fettman MJ, Hand MS, Salman MD, Wheeler SL.**
"Effects of chemotherapy and remission on carbohydrate metabolism in dogs with lymphoma."
*Cancer.* 1992;69(1):233-238.
PMID: [1727668](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1727668/)

**Key Findings:**
- Hyperlactatemia and hyperinsulinemia did not improve when dogs with lymphoma were put into remission with doxorubicin chemotherapy
- Metabolic alterations persist despite successful treatment

## Omega-3 Fatty Acids & Survival

**Ogilvie GK, Fettman MJ, Mallinckrodt CH, Walton JA, Hansen RA, Davenport DJ, Gross KL, Richardson KL, Rogers Q, Hand MS.**
"Effect of fish oil, arginine, and doxorubicin chemotherapy on remission and survival time for dogs with lymphoma: A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study."
*Cancer.* 2000;88(8):1916-1928.
PMID: [10760765](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10760765/)
DOI: [10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000415)88:8<1916::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-F](https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000415)88:8<1916::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-F)

**Key Findings:**
- Dogs with lymphoma treated with doxorubicin + fish oil (EPA/DHA) + arginine showed:
  - Longer disease-free interval (DFI)
  - Increased survival time (ST)
- Stage III dogs: Survival 700 days with supplemented diet vs 400 days without
- Time to recurrence: 425 days vs 275 days
- Higher plasma DHA levels correlated with better diet tolerance and outcomes

## Ketogenic Diet Research

**Phungviwatnikul T, Valentine H, de Godoy MRC, Swanson KS.**
"Ketogenic diets in healthy dogs induce gut and serum metabolome changes suggestive of anti-tumourigenic effects: A model for human ketotherapy trials."
*Clinical and Translational Medicine.* 2022;12(9):e1065.
PMID: [36148603](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36148603/)
PMCID: [PMC9506423](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9506423/)
DOI: [10.1002/ctm2.1065](https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.1065)

**Key Findings:**
- Short-term feeding of ketogenic diets in dogs significantly shifted the metabolome towards an anti-tumorigenic molecular signature
- KD produced significant shifts in serum metabolome suggesting down-regulation of glycolytic and amino-acid-dependent metabolism of many tumour types

**Tavener SK, Jackson MI, Panickar KS.**
"Immune-Modulating Effects of Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Foods in Healthy Canines."
*Current Developments in Nutrition.* 2024 Feb 28;8(4):102133.
PMID: [38590952](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38590952/)
PMCID: [PMC10999821](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10999821/)
DOI: [10.1016/j.cdnut.2024.102133](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdnut.2024.102133)

**Key Findings:**
- Ketogenic diet in dogs showed reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines
- Improved mitochondrial function observed
- Reduced inflammation markers

## EPA/DHA Supplementation Systematic Review

**Maki JJ, Kang SY, Muñoz R, Varshney D, Sordillo LM, Hensley CE.**
"Therapeutic Effect of EPA/DHA Supplementation in Neoplastic and Non-neoplastic Companion Animal Diseases: A Systematic Review."
*Frontiers in Physiology.* 2021 Jun 7;12:651108.
PMID: [34163372](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34163372/)
PMCID: [PMC8193331](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8193331/)
DOI: [10.3389/fphys.2021.651108](https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2021.651108)

**Key Findings:**
- EPA and DHA supplementation shows therapeutic benefits in companion animals with neoplastic diseases
- Particularly effective for maintaining body condition and reducing inflammation

## Nutritional Guidelines from Veterinary Textbooks

### Small Animal Clinical Nutrition (5th Edition)
Hand MS, Thatcher CD, Remillard RL, Roudebush P, Novotny BJ (eds).
Mark Morris Institute, 2010.

**Key Statements:**
- "Carbohydrate metabolism is dramatically altered in dogs with cancer"
- "Tumors preferentially metabolize glucose for energy"

### Canine and Feline Nutrition: A Resource for Companion Animal Professionals (3rd Edition)
Case LP, Daristotle L, Hayek MG, Raasch MF.
Mosby Elsevier, 2011.

**Key Statements:**
- Diet for cancer patients "should emphasize calories originating from fat and protein, rather than from carbohydrate, because fatty acids and amino acids are not the preferred fuel source for most tumors"

## Clinical Recommendations Summary

Based on the peer-reviewed literature above:

### Macronutrient Targets
| Nutrient | Target | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Protein | 30-45% of calories | Preserve muscle mass, combat cachexia |
| Fat | 30-50% of calories | Primary energy source; cancer cells inefficient at fat metabolism |
| Carbohydrates | <15-25% (ideally near zero) | Reduce glucose availability to tumor cells |

### EPA/DHA Supplementation
- **Dose:** 50-100 mg combined EPA+DHA per kg body weight per day
- **Example:** 22 kg dog = 1,100-2,200 mg EPA+DHA daily

### Calcium Supplementation (Home-Prepared Diets)
- **Dose:** 50-60 mg elemental calcium per kg body weight per day
- **Source:** Eggshell powder (~500-550 mg per 1/2 tsp) or calcium carbonate

### Daily Food Intake
- **Amount:** 2.5-3.0% of body weight in cooked food per day
- **Example:** 22 kg dog = 550-660 g total food daily

### Approved Protein Sources
- Eggs (limit 2-3/day)
- Chicken, turkey
- Beef, lamb
- Fish (sardines preferred; tuna limited to 2-3 meals/week due to mercury)

### Approved Fat Sources
- Fish oil (EPA/DHA)
- Animal fats (from meats)
- Coconut oil (small amounts)
- Olive oil (small amounts)

### Foods to Avoid
- All grains (rice, wheat, corn, oats)
- Legumes (soy, peas)
- Starchy vegetables (potato, sweet potato)
- Sugary treats
- Fruit

## Important Limitations

1. **Diet is supportive, not curative.** Nutritional intervention does not replace medical treatment for lymphoma or other cancers.

2. **Individual variation.** Some dogs may not tolerate high-fat diets. Adjust based on stool quality and GI tolerance.

3. **Consultation recommended.** Work with a veterinary oncologist or board-certified veterinary nutritionist for individualized guidance.

4. **Cancer cell adaptation.** Some cancer cells can utilize ketones for energy. The ketogenic approach may be more effective for certain tumor types than others.
