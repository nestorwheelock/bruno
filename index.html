                    <p class="highlight">Six years of unconditional love.</p>
                    <p>Bruno and Tatum are inseparable. Where one goes, the other follows. He's not just a dog—he's a best friend, a protector, a constant source of comfort through every hard day and quiet night.</p>
                    <p>Now Bruno has been diagnosed with <strong>lymphoma</strong>. He's still happy, still wagging his tail, still looking at us like nothing is wrong. That's what makes this so hard.</p>

                            <p>Bruno doesn't know what lymphoma means. He just knows he wants to be close to us, to play, to rest his head in our laps. His spirit hasn't changed—and we're fighting to keep it that way for as long as we can.</p>

                            <p>With only one income and no savings to fall back on, the cost of treatment feels impossible. We cancelled Christmas travel to stay by his side. We'd give anything for more time with him—but we need help to make it happen.</p>
